To commit:
	1. Track the files using 'git add -A' // add all files in all directories
	2. Commit using 'git commit -m "First commit"' // make meaningful commit messages

Pag walang nakaset up na git user mage-error.

To set up user without changes being visible globally (useful for lab):
	git config user.email "jaruz@up.edu.ph"
	git config user.name "Julianne Ruz"

Omitting '--global' will keep your name from being attached to someone else's commit.

Workflow (most basic):
	
	write changes to file >>> git add -A >> git commit -m "commit message" >> repeat

Changes not staged for commit: repeat the same workflow

Workflow: git checkout target-branch --> git merge source-branch
